1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
   
  - ReactJS is an open-source Javascript library for building highly interactive user interfaces especially for single page applications. 
  - The problem it tries to solve in addition to making it easier to building single page applications is that it allows an entire application to be broken down into re-usable components and hence drastically reducing repetitions and redundancy in the codebase.
  - It makes it easier for the application to be tested and improves the overall performance of the application.
  - It complies to the DRY principle in building a software.

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
    - To think in React means to think of everything as a piece of re-usable component.

3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational 
  component.
  - A Class/Stateful component as the name indicates has a piece of data (state) that can change while Functional/Presentational component only renders the data passed to it inform of props and renders same as is.

4.  Describe state.
   - A state is an object which determines the behaviour of a component and how it's rendered.
